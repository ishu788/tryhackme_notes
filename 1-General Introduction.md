#### Cybersecurity, or security, is the practice of ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information by protecting networks, devices, people, and data from unauthorized access or criminal exploitation.



 #### A security audit is a review of an organization's security records, activities, and other related documents. For example, an analyst may examine in-house security issues, such as making sure that confidential information, like individual computer passwords, isn't available to all employees


 - Compliance is the process of adhering to internal standards and external regulations and enables organizations to avoid fines and security breaches.

 - Security frameworks are guidelines used for building plans to help mitigate risks and threats to data and privacy.

- Security controls are safeguards designed to reduce specific security risks. They are used with security frameworks to establish a strong security posture.

- Security posture is an organization’s ability to manage its defense of critical assets and data and react to change. A strong security posture leads to lower risk for the organization.

- A threat actor, or malicious attacker, is any person or group who presents a security risk. This risk can relate to computers, applications, networks, and data.




## Skills

#### Communication is a transferable skill for a security analyst. They will often need to describe certain threats, risks, or vulnerabilities to people who may not have a technical background.

#### Another transferable skill is collaboration. Security analysts often work in teams with engineers, digital forensic investigators, and program managers.


#### The last transferable skill that we'll discuss is problem-solving. Identifying a security problem and then diagnosing it and providing solutions is a necessary skill to keep business operations safe. Understanding threat actors and identifying trends can provide insight on how to handle future threats.

## Personally identifiable information, known as PII, is any information used to infer an individual's identity. PII includes someone's full name, date of birth, physical address, phone number, email address, internet protocol, or IP address and similar information.

## Sensitive personally identifiable information, known as SPII, is a specific type of PII that falls under stricter handling guidelines and may include social security numbers, medical or financial information, and biometric data, such as facial recognition. If SPII is stolen, this has the potential to be significantly more damaging to an individual than if PII is stolen.

# SPII is more dangerous if stolen



## Threats

- computer virus is malicious code written to interfere with computer operations and cause damage to data and software. The virus attaches itself to programs or documents on a computer, then spreads and infects one or more computers in a network.

- Social engineering is a manipulation technique that exploits human error to gain private information, access, or valuables.

### 1. Phishing

- Business Email Compromise (BEC): A threat actor sends an email message that seems to be from a known source to make a seemingly legitimate request for information, in order to obtain a financial advantage.

- Spear phishing: A malicious email attack that targets a specific user or group of users. The email seems to originate from a trusted source.

- Whaling: A form of spear phishing. Threat actors target company executives to gain access to sensitive data.

- Vishing: The exploitation of electronic voice communication to obtain sensitive information or to impersonate a known source.

- Smishing: The use of text messages to trick users, in order to obtain sensitive information or to impersonate a known source.


### 2. Malware 
is software designed to harm devices or networks. There are many types of malware. The primary purpose of malware is to obtain money, or in some cases, an intelligence advantage that can be used against a person, an organization, or a territory.  
- Viruses: Malicious code written to interfere with computer operations and cause damage to data and software. A virus needs to be initiated by a user (i.e., a threat actor), who transmits the virus via a malicious attachment or file download. When someone opens the malicious attachment or download, the virus hides itself in other files in the now infected system. When the infected files are opened, it allows the virus to insert its own code to damage and/or destroy data in the system.
- Worms: Malware that can duplicate and spread itself across systems on its own. In contrast to a virus, a worm does not need to be downloaded by a user. Instead, it self-replicates and spreads from an already infected computer to other devices on the same network.
- Ransomware: A malicious attack where threat actors encrypt an organization's data and demand payment to restore access. 
- Spyware: Malware that’s used to gather and sell information without consent. Spyware can be used to access devices. This allows threat actors to collect personal data, such as private emails, texts, voice and image recordings, and locations.


### 3. Social Engineering
Social engineering is a manipulation technique that exploits human error to gain private information, access, or valuables. Human error is usually a result of trusting someone without question. It’s the mission of a threat actor, acting as a social engineer, to create an environment of false trust and lies to exploit as many people as possible. 

- Social media phishing: A threat actor collects detailed information about their target from social media sites. Then, they initiate an attack.

- Watering hole attack: A threat actor attacks a website frequently visited by a specific group of users.

- USB baiting: A threat actor strategically leaves a malware USB stick for an employee to find and install, to unknowingly infect a network. 

- Physical social engineering: A threat actor impersonates an employee, customer, or vendor to obtain unauthorized access to a physical location.

1. <b> Security and risk management. </b> - Security and risk management focuses on defining security goals and objectives, risk mitigation, compliance, business continuity, and the law. For example, security analysts may need to update company policies related to private health information if a change is made to a federal compliance regulation such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, also known as HIPAA.

2. <b> Asset security - </b> This domain focuses on securing digital and physical assets. It's also related to the storage, maintenance, retention, and destruction of data. When working with this domain, security analysts may be tasked with making sure that old equipment is properly disposed of and destroyed, including any type of confidential information.

3. <b> Security architecture and engineering. </b>This domain focuses on optimizing data security by ensuring effective tools, systems, and processes are in place. As a security analyst, you may be tasked with configuring a firewall. A firewall is a device used to monitor and filter incoming and outgoing computer network traffic. Setting up a firewall correctly helps prevent attacks that could affect productivity.

4. <b> Communication and network security. </b> This domain focuses on managing and securing physical networks and wireless communications. As a security analyst, you may be asked to analyze user behavior within your organization.

5.  identity and access management. Identity and access management focuses on keeping data secure, by ensuring users follow established policies to control and manage physical assets, like office spaces, and logical assets, such as networks and applications. Validating the identities of employees and documenting access roles are essential to maintaining the organization's physical and digital security. For example, as a security analyst, you may be tasked with setting up employees' keycard access to buildings.

6. security assessment and testing. This domain focuses on conducting security control testing, collecting and analyzing data, and conducting security audits to monitor for risks, threats, and vulnerabilities. Security analysts may conduct regular audits of user permissions, to make sure that users have the correct level of access. For example, access to payroll information is often limited to certain employees, so analysts may be asked to regularly audit permissions to ensure that no unauthorized person can view employee salaries.

7. security operations. This domain focuses on conducting investigations and implementing preventative measures. Imagine that you, as a security analyst, receive an alert that an unknown device has been connected to your internal network. You would need to follow the organization's policies and procedures to quickly stop the potential threat.

8. software development security. This domain focuses on using secure coding practices, which are a set of recommended guidelines that are used to create secure applications and services. A security analyst may work with software development teams to ensure security practices are incorporated into the software development life-cycle. If, for example, one of your partner teams is creating a new mobile app, then you may be asked to advise on the password policies or ensure that any user data is properly secured and managed.



# Threat actor types
Advanced persistent threats
Advanced persistent threats (APTs) have significant expertise accessing an organization's network without authorization. APTs tend to research their targets (e.g., large corporations or government entities)  in advance and can remain undetected for an extended period of time. Their intentions and motivations can include:

- Damaging critical infrastructure, such as the power grid and natural resources

- Gaining access to intellectual property, such as trade secrets or patents

- Insider threats
Insider threats abuse their authorized access to obtain data that may harm an organization. Their intentions and motivations can include: 

Sabotage,Corruption,Espionage,Unauthorized data access or leaks 

### Hacktivists
Hacktivists are threat actors that are driven by a political agenda. They abuse digital technology to accomplish their goals, which may include: 



Demonstrations,Propaganda,Social change campaigns,Fame




### SIEM tools reduce the amount of data an analyst must review by providing alerts for specific types of risks and threats. Next, let's go over examples of commonly used SIEM tools: Splunk and Chronicle.

### Splunk is a data analysis platform, and Splunk Enterprise provides SIEM solutions. Splunk Enterprise is a self-hosted tool used to retain, analyze, and search an organization's log data. Another SIEM tool is Google's Chronicle. Chronicle is a cloud-native SIEM tool that stores security data for search and analysis. Cloud-native means that Chronicle allows for fast delivery of new features.





# Certificate 2

we'll examine how to manage risks by using the National Institute of Standards and Technology's Risk Management Framework, known as the NIST RMF.


- security goals and objectives, organizations can reduce risks to critical assets and data like PII, or personally identifiable information. 
- Risk mitigation means having the right procedures and rules in place to quickly reduce the impact of a risk like a breach. 
- Compliance is the primary method used to develop an organization's internal security policies, regulatory requirements, and independent standards. 
- Business continuity relates to an organization's ability to maintain their everyday productivity by establishing risk disaster recovery plans.


An example of a risk to an organization might be the lack of backup protocols for making sure its stored information can be recovered in the event of an accident or security incident. Organizations tend to rate risks at different levels: low, medium, and high, depending on possible threats and the value of an asset.


NIST's Risk Management Framework or RMF. As an entry-level analyst, you may not engage in all of these steps, but it's important to be familiar with this framework. Having a solid foundational understanding of how to mitigate and manage risks can set yourself apart from other candidates as you begin your job search in the field of security.


There are seven steps in the RMF: prepare, categorize, select, implement, assess, authorize, and monitor.


Security frameworks are guidelines used for building plans to help mitigate risks and threats to data and privacy, such as social engineering attacks and ransomware. Security involves more than just the virtual space. It also includes the physical, which is why many organizations have plans to maintain safety in the work environment. For example, access to a building may require using a key card or badge.







three common types of controls: encryption, authentication, and authorization.
