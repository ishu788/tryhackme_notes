 Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis

 Incidents are classified using a rating of urgency and impact. Urgency will be determined by the type of attack faced, where the impact will be determined by the affected system and what impact that has on business operations.


<br>

 ### Preparation	
 Do we have the resources and plans in place to deal with the security incident?
### Identification	
Has the threat and the threat actor been correctly identified in order for us to respond to?
### Containment	
Can the threat/security incident be contained to prevent other systems or users from being impacted?
### Eradication	
Remove the active threat.
### Recovery 	
Perform a full review of the impacted systems to return to business as usual operations.
### Lessons Learned
